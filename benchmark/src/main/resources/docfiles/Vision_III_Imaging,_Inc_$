Vision III Imaging is a company located in Reston, Virginia that specializes in depth enhancement parallax imaging technologies. It has developed the v3 parallax scanning technology for capturing and recording visual parallax information to high definition (HD), Digital Cinema, 3D graphics, and video games.1The v3 brand is used by Vision III Imaging, Inc. to identify its parallax scanning technology.2The v3 optical and software tools were designed to capture and/or format three-dimensional depth information (parallax) in a manner that exploits certain human visual perceptual mechanisms when viewed on standard unaided displays. The tools exploit certain short-term visual memory and depth-mapping psychophysical processes.3The company has received a total of 20 issued United States patents with three currently pending, three European Patent Office patents with four pending, two Canadian patents with three pending, one Japanese patent with two pending, and one South Korean patent with one pending.4,5The company’s v3 technology hardware and software product brands include:The AX3 is designed to be inserted into a standard HD camera lens’ optical path at or near the plane of the iris allowing the capture of parallax views.AX3 Technical Specifications:The 35mm MOE Prime lenses are PL-mount compatible lenses that allow cinematographers to capture parallax scanned images on 35mm film or in a digital cinema format (4K).MOE lens specs:The Digital Parallax Scanner is the parallax scanning component of the AX3 HD zoom lens unit and the 35 mm MOE prime lenses. It is inserted into a lens’ optical path at the plane or near the plane of the iris allowing the capture of parallax views.The DPS employs two linear actuators and a central pivoting armature that holds the iris. The two parallel linear actuators have coordinated motion in such a way as to produce both x and y motions of the iris. For illustrative purposes think of the way, a tank moves. If both tank treads move forward/backward the “gun tip” moves forward/backward (both treads moving normally). If one tread moves opposite to the other (turning, both treads moving differentially) the “gun tip” would move left or right. It is this type of differential motion that allows the iris to be positioned in any area of the optical axis in the lens, and do it in the smallest possible space. The linear actuators consist of a moving coil and fixed magnetic yoke assembly, very similar to the typical actuator that controls the read/write heads in a computer hard drive. By incorporating miniature, high-resolution optical encoders, the entire scanner mechanism control system becomes digital.1. Hammer, Ben.
